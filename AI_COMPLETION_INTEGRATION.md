## Settings Configuration

### Default Settings Added
```javascript
'completion.enabled': true,
'completion.debounceMs': 300,
'completion.maxCompletions': 10,
'completion.enableStreaming': true,
'completion.enableCaching': true,
'completion.minTriggerLength': 1,
'completion.maxContextLength': 10000,
'completion.enablePersonalization': true,
'completion.autoTrigger': true,
'completion.triggerCharacters': ['.', '(', '[', '{', ':', ' ', '<']
```

### Runtime Configuration
- Settings can be updated via `Settings.updateCompletionSettings()`
- Changes immediately propagate to all completion components
- Event-driven architecture ensures consistency

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **LLM Services**: Uses existing service factory and provider infrastructure
- **Symbol Resolution**: Leverages current AST parsing and symbol tracking
- **Code Intelligence**: Integrates with Senior Engineer AI modules
- **Settings System**: Extends existing settings with completion-specific options
- **Performance Monitoring**: Uses existing performance optimization framework

### Database Storage
- User patterns and preferences stored in IndexedDB
- Completion history and metrics persistence
- Settings synchronized with existing database schema

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Automatic Operation**: Completions trigger automatically while typing
2. **Manual Trigger**: Press Ctrl/Cmd+Space to manually request completions
3. **Toggle Feature**: Press Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+A to enable/disable AI completions
4. **Personalization**: System learns from your selection patterns automatically

### For Developers
1. **Extending Context**: Add new context analyzers to `ContextIntelligenceEngine`
2. **Custom Prompts**: Add specialized prompts to `CompletionModelManager`
3. **New Triggers**: Extend trigger logic in `AiCompletionProvider`
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Access metrics via `getPerformanceMetrics()` methods

## Performance Characteristics

### Optimizations
- **Debounced Requests**: 300ms debounce prevents excessive API calls
- **Intelligent Caching**: Context and completion caching with LRU eviction
- **Request Cancellation**: Automatic cancellation of superseded requests
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking context analysis where possible

### Metrics Tracking
- **Completion Success Rate**: Tracks successful vs failed completion requests
- **User Acceptance Rate**: Measures how often users accept AI suggestions
- **Response Latency**: Monitors API response times and optimization opportunities
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Tracks caching effectiveness

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- **LLM Service Failures**: Falls back to basic Monaco completions
- **Context Analysis Errors**: Continues with reduced context information
