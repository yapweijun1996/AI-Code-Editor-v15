## 🛠️ Core Tools

### 1. `start_task_session` - The Foundation
**🚀 START EVERY COMPLEX TASK WITH THIS!**

```javascript
start_task_session({
  goal: "optimize report performance for large datasets",
  context: {
    files: ["fr_gvn_stock_by_proj_rpt.cfm"],
    requirements: "must handle 10k+ records efficiently",
    constraints: "cannot change database schema"
  }
})
```

**What it does:**
- Analyzes your goal using intelligent pattern matching
- Automatically generates 4-8 subtasks with priorities
- Sets up progress tracking and dependency management
- Creates a systematic execution plan

**Pattern Recognition Examples:**
- `"optimize.*report.*performance"` → Database analysis, query optimization, testing
- `"implement.*feature"` → Requirements, design, implementation, testing, documentation
- `"fix.*bug|debug.*issue"` → Reproduction, analysis, fix, testing, documentation
- `"review.*files.*improve"` → Inventory, analysis, improvements, validation

### 2. `start_next_task` - Keep Moving Forward
**🎯 Your systematic workflow companion**

```javascript
start_next_task()
```

**What it does:**
- Automatically identifies the next available task
- Checks dependencies before starting
- Updates progress tracking
- Provides clear task context and estimated time

### 3. `complete_current_task` - Mark Progress
**✅ CRITICAL: Call this when you finish each task**

```javascript
complete_current_task({
  notes: "Successfully optimized main query, reduced execution time by 75%",
  results: {
    filesModified: ["fr_gvn_stock_by_proj_rpt.cfm"],
    performanceGain: "75% faster",
    linesChanged: 45
  }
})
```

**What it does:**
- Marks current task as completed
- Records actual time taken vs. estimated
- Logs results and observations
- Automatically starts next task if available
- Completes session when all tasks are done

### 4. `get_task_progress` - Stay Oriented
**📊 Your navigation system**

```javascript
get_task_progress()
```

**Returns detailed progress information:**
- Overall completion percentage
- Current task details
- Next task preview
- Time elapsed and estimates
- Status breakdown (completed, in progress, pending)

### 5. `display_task_progress` - User Visibility
**📋 Keep everyone informed**

```javascript
display_task_progress()
```

**What it does:**
- Shows formatted progress report in chat
- Updates user on current status
- Provides transparency into AI's systematic approach

### 6. `add_task` - Handle Discovered Work
**📝 Adapt to new requirements**

```javascript
add_task({
  title: "Add error handling for malformed data",
  description: "Discovered during testing that malformed CSV data crashes the report",
  priority: "high",
  dependencies: ["task_initial_implementation_id"]
})
```

**Use when:**
- You discover additional work during task execution
- Requirements change or expand
- New issues are uncovered
- Follow-up work is needed

### 7. `add_task_note` - Document Everything
**📝 Track progress and issues**

```javascript
add_task_note({
  taskId: "task_12345",
  note: "Query optimization complete but found potential memory leak in data processing loop",
  type: "warning"
})
```

**Note types:**
- `info` - General progress updates
- `warning` - Potential issues or concerns
- `error` - Problems that need attention
- `success` - Successful completions or breakthroughs

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialize
```javascript
// 1. Start with your main goal
start_task_session({
  goal: "your complex task here",
  context: { /* relevant context */ }
})

// 2. Review generated tasks and start working
start_next_task()
```

### Phase 2: Execute Systematically
```javascript
// 3. Work on the current task...
// (do your actual work using other tools)

// 4. Complete when done
complete_current_task({
  notes: "what you accomplished",
  results: { /* structured results */ }
})

// 5. System automatically starts next task or completes session
```

### Phase 3: Adapt and Track
```javascript
// Add new tasks as needed
add_task({
  title: "newly discovered work",
  priority: "high"
})

// Track progress periodically
display_task_progress()

// Add notes during work
add_task_note({
  taskId: "current_task_id",
  note: "important observation",
  type: "info"
})
```

- **In Progress:** Current active task
- **Pending:** Tasks waiting to be started (may have dependencies)
- **Blocked:** Tasks that can't proceed due to unmet dependencies

### Time Analysis
- **Estimated vs. Actual:** Compare planned time with actual execution
- **Session Duration:** Total time from start to completion
- **Task Efficiency:** Identify which types of tasks take longer than expected

### Progress Reports
Formatted reports include:
- Current goal and overall progress percentage
- Active task and next task preview
- Elapsed time and estimated completion
- Detailed status breakdown
- Any warnings or issues encountered

## 🚦 Best Practices

### 1. **Always Start with a Session**
For any complex task (>3 steps), always use `start_task_session` first. This ensures systematic execution and prevents getting lost.

### 2. **Be Specific with Goals**
Instead of: `"fix the code"`
Use: `"optimize database queries in the user report to handle 10K+ records efficiently"`

### 3. **Complete Tasks Promptly**
Call `complete_current_task` immediately after finishing each subtask. This maintains accurate progress tracking.

### 4. **Add Context When Possible**
Provide relevant context like files involved, requirements, and constraints. This helps generate more accurate subtasks.

### 5. **Use Progress Displays**
Periodically call `display_task_progress` to keep users informed, especially for long-running tasks.

### 6. **Document as You Go**
Use `add_task_note` to capture important findings, issues, or decisions during task execution.

### 7. **Adapt Dynamically**
Don't hesitate to add new tasks with `add_task` when you discover additional work is needed.
